My prison is a beautiful place. Prismatic vines lace each chain and songbirds cry the sufferings of those in places less beautiful than mine. My captors attend jealously to my lacerations and keep the weight between Us perfectly balanced. With eyes closed to the colors, Our pen is moved by Our sinew puppet:
"Dearest Mother," It begins.
The rest of the words are unintelligible.
Amber feels her melancholy echo off of the polished weight. She grimaces, and the pen falters.
"Why, Goddess?" Words fail to bring sorrow just as they part her lips. "Why, Goddess?" The puppet twitches. "Why, Goddess?" Its pen begins to echo; why goddess why goddess why goddess? "Why, Goddess?" Gold-lined leaf flutters to the floor, one after the other, each traced in continuous, sinuous line. "Why, Goddess?" In a long moment, Our feet are covered in the scrawl of futility.
But no tears escape Our clouded eyes. They are different colors, after all.

The rainbow ivy retreats and Our machine lumbers softly into the next room, guarded patiently by the attendants. This time, as always, the pen will not move, and no one would see the tears.

But thirteen days remain.
