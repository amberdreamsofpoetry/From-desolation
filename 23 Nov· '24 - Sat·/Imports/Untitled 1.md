Player returns to base after a year. Since the software is running on a lower-end machine, only monthly updates are checked. A model generates a description of the desired random events and passes them on to the game coordinator, who validates them and their probabilities before passing them on to the object manager for finalization. This is repeated for each month. The final collection of objects is presented to the player.

Interesting things are always happening off screen!
