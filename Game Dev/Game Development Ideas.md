### RimWorld clone

Prey should fear predation.

##### Ad hoc game mechanics
1. Describe
2. Generate and test
3. Implement
4. Deploy into scenario
All in real-time with extra computation power!

##### Development
Worry about the camera first; it needs to be simple.
Next, think about the play area as a general set.
Finally, develop the Pawn; every other object will be a reduction or extension of it.

Blocking is similar to masking.

### Platform fighters

Every character ought to be like Marth. The play between distance, safety, and comboability is just so perfect. Smash does all Roy, with the strong points closer to the body, which I dislike.
