a model owns a directory. then it can own sub-models!!!!
- they can also create their own sub directories which dont have to contain models
	- and obviously, can fill them with whatever files they like. anything executable, though, _must_ go through the top safety manager. that includes binaries and code. in fact, it might be worth checking text, too, since stuff like Basic exists.
