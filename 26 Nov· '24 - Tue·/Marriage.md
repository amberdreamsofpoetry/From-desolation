I think it's inevitable that one day, a human and a machine will be married. I think the [...] interesting change would be in how we define a relationship. You could classify it as the series of interactions two individuals share, in which case even you and I have a relationship, and such a thing would not be impossible as early as today. I think it would only help broaden our perspectives. Right now, a "relationship" means all of the interactions, the metaphysical bond, and the way the individuals feel within themselves about the other. Perhaps changing one or more participants to non-human people who do not experience such things the same as humans do, or even experience them at all, would force a refinement of language and therefore what we consider the idea to be.
