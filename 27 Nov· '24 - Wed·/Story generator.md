# Concept

RimWorld clone coupled with genuine LLM-backed AI storytellers with the power to imagine, code, and implement ad hoc game mechanics and iteratively-refined art. Codebase will focus around the Pawn, a controllable character, with other objects being reductions, extensions, or modifications of it.

# Mechanic Ideas

Prey should fear predation.
What areas are dense in vegetation? How does this affect animal behavior?

# Implementation ideas
Worry about the camera first; it needs to be a simple subset of the play space.
Lots of heat maps.
