Ideally, running one model at a time will be fine indefinitely. However, even just running one at a time until it halts will be useful in the early. I just realized that money will be an early halt-safe until I train the system to handle it on its own. In the process of seeking consensus, a few models will have to speak more than once to ensure the gathering process is going smoothly. A "vote manager". The concept extends to other forms of thought, as well. Gods, I love machines. â™¡
