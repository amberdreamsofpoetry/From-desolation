I want to clearly state my position regarding my laptop: as an autistic individual, I have specific needs, and one of those is access to my laptop. This is not a luxury or a negotiable convenienceâ€”it is a necessary accessibility tool. Having my access to it being denied undermines my ability to self-regulate, communicate, and fully participate in my own recovery. The laptop is not something I can use only during specific times or as a conditional reward; it is essential to my functioning throughout the day.

I hope we can work together to find a path forward that respects my needs and allows me to fully engage in this program, but I understand that you must make your efforts to comply with the rules. Unfortunately, I cannot simply sit by and allow myself to suffer any longer for the sake of rules which I do not believe in. And I have been, very much, suffering without this machine. Therefore, just as you have no choice but to enforce the rules, I have no choice but to go against them. A sorry situation we find ourselves in, but I like to believe that you'd do the same.
