Humor me while I delve deeply into highly theoretical (and therefore highly likely to be wrong) physics.

I think that black holes are either an illusion caused by distant space and time or alive on the inside of their event horizons, like a brain inside a skull.

Regarding the first idea, I think it's possible that space and time are actually just smooth all the way and what we are seeing are parts of the universe that are further in the future than we are, if you think of the universe as a big machine which takes in the uneven ocean of the most-present and raises all its points a bit into the future one at a time. I'll animate what I mean one day. #todo . Regarding the second, if there is some amount of infinity inside of there, it makes sense that the singularity would be much, _much_ more information-dense than the three points of data we can gather from it; we are just seeing hair color, eye color, and skin color and using it to infer the inner workings of someone's mind.
