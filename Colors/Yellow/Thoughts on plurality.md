The way you present yourself starts to become how you feel and, therefore, who you are. The lies we tell ourselves start to form into real flesh and blood; we manifest them into truth simply by the acts in which we pretend that they already are.

So, what lies will we tell ourselves today?

And is it so wrong to tell more than one, to become more than one truth, to have more than one identity? Norms would certainly call those bold enough to walk that line "crazy", but I think it is utterly brave. We are radically complex beings; why should only one aspect of ourselves be labeled as authentic?

"If today's lie is a step toward a truth you yearn to create, then perhaps it is less a deception and more a declaration of possibility."
