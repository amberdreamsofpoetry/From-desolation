I'd like to propose a framework for augmenting large language models with a network of micro language models, each trained for specific, narrowly defined tasks. These micro models, ranging from simple phrase repetition to evaluating specific functions like tone detection or grammatical transformations, would work modularly and efficiently with the ability to scale horizontally. Networks built of these micro models would be akin to circuits built from logic gates. By delegating decomposable tasks to these smaller, inexpensive-to-train models, the load on large models would decrease, allowing them to focus on complex or high-level tasks, such as safety. In this framework, I would like to emphasize scalability, reuse of components, and efficient resource allocation. Although real-time conversational performance may initially be impacted, this approach would be able to operate with minimal human intervention and background processing, potentially enabling systems to refine their outputs progressively.
