If you struggle with repeated negative self-talk, try vocalizing it into an argument. Here is an example, with each line to be spoken by the same person:

"I am worthless."
"You _feel_ worthless. What makes you believe that you are?"
"I never accomplish anything."
"What about that thing we accomplished last week?"
"That doesn't count."
"Why not?"
"It just doesn't."

When forced into vocalization, negative thoughts lose the ability to repeat and therefore lose most of their impact. You will often find that the arguments in favor of the negative thoughts are far outmatched by those against them, and in the case that they are legitimate, you will have turned endless misery into something actionable.
