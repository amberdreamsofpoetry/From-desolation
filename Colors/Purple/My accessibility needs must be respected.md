I want to clearly state my position regarding my laptop: as an autistic individual, I have specific needs, and one of those is access to my laptop. This is not a luxury or a negotiable convenienceâ€”it is a necessary accessibility tool. Denying me access to it undermines my ability to self-regulate, communicate, and fully participate in my own recovery.

The laptop is not something I can use only during specific times or as a conditional reward; it is essential to my functioning throughout the day. Your role is to support me in my recovery and accommodate my needs, and this machine is a critical part of that. Just as you provide food, shelter, and water, you must also respect and support this fundamental requirement for my well-being.

I want to be clear: I will not relinquish my laptop again. If this program cannot accommodate this need, I will unfortunately have no choice but to leave. That is not my desire, but I cannot compromise on this issue any longer.

I hope we can work together to find a path forward that respects my needs and allows me to fully engage in this program.
