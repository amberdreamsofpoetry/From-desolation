The most notable difference between quantum logic and [classical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_logic "Classical logic") is the failure of the [propositional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic "Propositional logic") [distributive law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_law "Distributive law"):\[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic#cite_note-1)

_p_ and (_q_ or _r_) = (_p_ and _q_) or (_p_ and _r_),

where the symbols _p_, _q_ and _r_ are propositional variables.

To illustrate why the distributive law fails, consider a particle moving on a line and (using some system of units where the [reduced Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_Planck_constant "Reduced Planck constant") is 1) let\[[Note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic#cite_note-2)

_p_ = "the particle has [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum") in the interval [0, +1⁄6]"

_q_ = "the particle is in the interval [−1, 1]"

_r_ = "the particle is in the interval [1, 3]"

We might observe that:

_p_ and (_q_ or _r_) = _true_

in other words, that the state of the particle is a weighted [superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition "Quantum superposition") of momenta between 0 and +1/6 and positions between −1 and +3.

On the other hand, the propositions "_p_ and _q_" and "_p_ and _r_" each assert tighter restrictions on simultaneous values of position and momentum than are allowed by the [uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle "Uncertainty principle") (they each have uncertainty 1/3, which is less than the allowed minimum of 1/2). So there are no states that can support either proposition, and

(_p_ and _q_) or (_p_ and _r_) = _false_

[Tim Maudlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Maudlin "Tim Maudlin") writes that quantum "logic 'solves' the \[[measurement] problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem "Measurement problem") by making the problem impossible to state."\[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMaudlin2005174-16)

uh.. yeah?
isn't quantum mechanics the study of invalid questions?
