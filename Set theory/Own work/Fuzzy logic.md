# Generated summary

Fuzzy logic is a computing method that uses degrees of truth to model logical reasoning with vague or imprecise statements. It's based on the idea that the truth value of a variable can be any real number between 0 and 1, where 0 represents "totally false" and 1 represents "totally true".Â 

Fuzzy logic is used to solve problems with imprecise data by considering all available information and making the best decision. It's particularly useful in decision-making problems in uncertain environments, and is often used to model complicated issues that mirror human decision-making.
