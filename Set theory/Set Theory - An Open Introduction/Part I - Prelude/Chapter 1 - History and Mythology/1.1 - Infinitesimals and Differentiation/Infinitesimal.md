# Example

- formula for the first derivative of the [[Function|function]] $f$ at the point $c$:
$$
f'(c)=\frac{f(c + \beta) - f(c)}{\beta} \text{ where } \beta \text{ is infinitesimal.}
$$

# Thoughts

"'I admit that signs may be made to denote either any thing or nothing: and consequently that in the original notation $c+\beta$, $\beta$ might have signified either an increment or nothing. But then which of these soever you make it signify, you must argue consistently with such its signification, and not proceed upon a double meaning: Which to do were a manifest sophism.'"
- Why can't you just be consistent and have a double meaning? Quantum mechanics has the superposition, so a similar thing is possible.
